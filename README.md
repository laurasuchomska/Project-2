### Introduction

This is the first complex lab activity for Module 2, in the Flatiron school bootcamp. The project incorporated everything we've learned about APIs, databases, and Object-Oriented Programming. 

The analysis in this project was conducted on the Delphi Footbal database, which contains information about soccer teams and the matches they've played in the file `database.sqlite`. For this project, our goal was to get the data we thought was important from the SQL database, run calculations and data transformations, and then store everything in a MongoDB database. 


### Summary Methodology

* Query the SQL database
* Calculate summary statistics
* Get the weather data from the DarkSky API
* Load the data into MongoDB
